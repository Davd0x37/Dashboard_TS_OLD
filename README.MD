# Dashboard

> Still in development

Dashboard for social media, communication and connect everything into one tool.

## Installing / Getting started

@TODO

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Developing

### Built With

Typescript 2.6.2 <br>
Express 4.16.0 <br>
GraphQL 0.12.3 <br>
Apollo server express 1.3.2 <br>
Argon2 | Argon-Node https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2

### Prerequisites

Just clone repo and use command listed below. Yarn will do everything for you.

```shell
yarn
```

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/DevDigitalNomad/DashboardTS.git
cd DashboardTS/
yarn
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

For build backend:

> Webpack watch

```shell
yarn run node_dev
```

> Webpack build production

```shell
yarn run node_build
```

Building frontend

> Parcel dev

```shell
yarn run web_dev
```

> Parcel production

```shell
yarn run web_build
```

Testing

> Backend

```shell
yarn run node_test
```

> Frontend

```shell
yarn run web_test
```

### Deploying / Publishing

give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.

## Database

Explaining what database (and version) has been used. Provide download links.
Documents your database design and schemas, relations etc...

## Licensing

State what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
